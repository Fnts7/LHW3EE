Version 6

Continuation of crossbow overhaul:
- Manually aimed shots now have +15% dmg bonus, but not split bolts nor explosives.
- Aimed shots bonus can be further raised with Lightning Reflexes skill: +3.33% per level.
- Auto shots will now have / 1.5 crit chance penalty
- Explosive bolts can deal self damage (it was vanilla bug that they didn't), however reduced self burning
damage greatly
- Adjusted crossbow experience awarding: manually aimed shots will give more exp than auto ones. Due to nature of 
explosive bolts, per target hit exp is much lower.
- mechanics improvement - if Geralt has to reload there are enemies very close, crossbow will force holster instead
This way you can avoid getting stuck for too long with reload and can defend or combo with sword right after shot.
- small input fix - if you cancel aiming by pressing e.g. space then release crossbow button, Geralt will not draw
and shot. That fix doesn't work on horse yet.

Small aard knockdown applicator adjustments.

Version 5

Bolts and crossbow balance and small overhaul. Bolts now differ better between each other and tried to made
other bolt types then explosive more useful. Armor piercing of target point bolts is more siginificant and
at same time precision skill gives less bolt armor piercing bonus. Made crossbow crit damage more significant.
Reduced overpowered burning effect of explosive bolts (duration was too long due to some weird logic). Bolt
prices adjusted. Split bolts deal much more damage (same as bodkin bolt, but have 2, or 3 projectiles), but have
no armor piercing. They are now also great for dealing point blank damage (but not that great on armored).


- red mutagens balance shift - reduced poise they give, increased HP
- green mutagens toxicity bonus boosted a bit


Version 4

- reduced ridiculously hight repair prices of high class equipment. The repair price function is not linear,
but regressive root function. So cheap equipment will still have similar repair prices.
- heightened senses skill small change. instead of percentage poise increase, the skill now gives base poise
of +2, +4, +5 depending on level. The effect of reducing poise reduction due to low hp stays the same.
- updated some ui descriptions

- counter attack skill lvl3 crit chance bonus lowered to +15%
- deadly precision now gives +7% crit chance on counter attack per level instead of 25% on level 3.
Those two defensive skills crit chance was OP concerning other changes in this mod

- steady shot skill damage bonus is now applied multiplicatively to base dmg, not attack power which made that
perk crap. Now it is better in comparison to e.g. Trick Shot


Version 3

- improved aard logic concerning knockdown applicator and force damage calculation - all skills better cowork with each other. scaling is more smooth
  aard is a bit stronger at base, force effects get weaker with lower sign power and increasing sign power does not boost aard that much.
- igni has higher base burn chance, but progresses slower with the 4th skill (skills shouldn be that strong)
- slightly boosted axii base success chance


Version 2

Lowered toxicity of every level white raffard by 5

Introduced new master and magical crafted sword roll sets:
- related with critical hit chance and damage
- new magical one 'StrongOrFast' - gives + str attack power, - str attack speed, - fast attack power, + fast attack speed

Str Training skill heavy attack speed bonus per level slightly lowered to 4.5%


Version 1

- bug fixes - 

poisoned blades skill not working

fixed ridiculous basic quen power

aard sweep fixed and rebalanced starts with -20% power for knockdown applicator, then -10%, 0% on higher levels.
higher levels also increase the values of all types of damages done by aard. /6, /4, /3.


- important mechanics -

Rend is now more armor-piercy, less max damage. Rend with no talent has +15% armor pierce on full load, +5% per skill level.
Also rend now gains base damage faster (fast rends start from great penalty). Boosted crit chance bonus to 7%
per skill level on full load. Rend skill now also raises a bit stamina dmg bonus per level.

Strong attacks have now base dmg multiplier of 1.25, removed attack power bonus of 20%.

eating food will now also give instant heal of small amount, based on food level: 100, 200, 400 accordingly.

Changed the logic of toxicity damage threshold, now it is not constant 50, but following:

  Min ( Max(25 + maxTox / 4.0f, decoction_offset), halfTox)
  
where
  maxTox - maximum toxicity, halfTox - half of toxicity
  decoction_offset - total toxicity of active decoctions
  
Explanation - toxicity damage threshold is increased at 50% rate with higher max tox. But if only decoctions intoxication
is present, the damage is not taken by Geralt. However if decoctions alone use more than 50% of maximum toxicity, that
triggers the damage also. Both 2 toxicity positive bonuses skills are changed so that they are active only if the toxicity
is above the new current threshold. Means that e.g. having just 1 decoction that is not 50% toxicity will not activate
those skills.


- skill balances -

Battle Trance perk now does not cancel basic BT effect which is +10% attack power per vigor point, but just adds its
effect of crit chance per vigor. Lowered that from 8% to 5%.

Hunter Instinct skill boosted to +5% crit damage per level on max vigor. Also the effect is now proportional to the
vigor percentage.

Metabolism perk raised to +25 toxicity (from 15)

Poisoned Blades rebalanced, so that skill level matters more and oil level less. lvl 3 oil and lvl5 skill will give 40%
chance of poisonin. 4% per level, x1,x1.5,x2 for oil levels accordingly.

Fast attacks second skill armor piercing boosted to +3% per skill level. Light attack has no armor piercing initially,
this value should be more significant.

Strong attack second skill small balance shift - armor piercing lowered to +2.5% per level
Crit damage raised to +5%.

Heightened Senses skill now has two new effects:
- increases poise by 5% per level, but not on lvl 3, so 10% max increase
- reduces the amount of poise lowered due to low HP. by 10% per skill level


- alchemy items -

thunderbolt boosted to +10%, 15%, 15% crit chance
cat lvl 1 a bit stronger, lvl2 a bit weaker
boosted a bit lvl2, lvl3 swallow

oils rebalanced to:
lvl1: +10% crit chance, +15% crit dmg
lvl2: +15%, +25%
lvl3: +15%, +30%, +10% reses reduction (exception hangman venom: +15%, +35%, + 5%)

blizzard slow motion duration increased and lvl3 now gives 1s longer duration and again 1s longer if vigor is max


- base attributes -

Geralt's base critical hit damage raised from +25% to +35%

  
- misc -

Samum crit chance bonus (for blinded enemies) changed so that all levels now give some bonus
+15%, +30%, +50%, so lvl is lowered from 100%.

Whirl crit chance is now not 0, but / 2 penalty instead.

Crossbow crit damage 

lowered a bit resist unblockable attacks poise threshold to 100%.


This mod is a publication of my own taste Witcher 3 Enhanced Edition. So obviously credit goes to the god of modding, mighty Reaperzz and all the authors of the mods that he used. The goal is to make W3EE less hardcore and more pleasant to play for not ultra hardcore players. Contains also bugfixes.

Typically most balance changed will be done evening up. So e.g. if I see that skill X is more powerful than Y in my opinion, I will make Y as strong as X. If I see a potion of same tier less powerful/useful than some other I will boost it.

Requirements:
W3EE﻿
Script Merger

When solving conflicts in Kdiff, look below the icon bar. You will see: A: [vanilla], B: [mod_1], C: [mod_2] OR A: [mod_1], B: [mod_2]. Go to 'merge' in menu and select 'choose X everywhere', where X is the name of this mod, that is modLHW3EE.
