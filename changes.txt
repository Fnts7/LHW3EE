Version 11

Crossbow and bolts:
- increased armor piercing values of target point bolts a bit
- Cold Blooded skill boosted - bonus per hit. Max boost remains the same. Also raised to 7s effect reset time.
- Crippling shots skill improved for broadhead bolts. Since bleeding is not stacking, instead for that type of
bolts bleeding effect is simply boosted - by about 8% per skill level.

Cooking:
- Small adjustments in food, so that recipes are more logical and balanced in two ways: multiplying food, 
upgrading food to better quality.

Big toxicity rework. First of all removed strange rule of greatly increasing potions toxicity when decoctions
active. I find it nonsense, because there is no point in investing in toxicity (green mutagens, perk, also
red wolf armor), if you cannot use normal potions with reasonable efficiency in addition to decoctions. So that
needed some balancing and nerfing some toxicity capabilities.
- Mutant skill decoctions toxicity per level reduced to 2, but duration is increased to 15% per skill level.
- Red wolf armor set toxicity gain overall reduced from 30 to 21.
- Metabolism perk toxicity gain reduced from 25 to 20
- Reduced the rate at which toxicity safe threshold is increased. Now it is increased by value of 1/6 of max tox
above 100 (was 1/4), so if you have 200 max tox. Threshold will be 66.667 (with exception of decoctions rule).
- food instant heal amount is reduced when intoxicated - progressive almost quadratic function, so will be small when
low tox, up to zero on 100% tox.

Potions adjustments. Two goals - increase toxicity where the gain from higher lvl potion is great and increase
the differences between potion tiers, where they were insignificant.
- Maribor forest. Lvl1 duration reduced, Lvl2 duration increased as it is the only gain. Lvl3 even more duration
and restores 2 vigor points instantly. Toxicity of lvl2, lvl3 raised.
- Golden oriole lvl1 doesn't give full poison res anymore, but 75% combined with Geralt base res, but toxicity reduced.
Lvl3 toxicity raised as its effect is very strong - healing with poison.
- Thunderbolt lvl3 has higher tox, but also longer duration and increased a bit crit frenzy activation chance.
- Cat was really overpowered in general, so lvl2,3 toxicities raised. all levels have lower duration, but still
quite high compared to other potions on average.


Water Hag decoction bug fix, so now it really works according to descriptions. Gives +20% attack power on full life,
then reducing proportionaly to 0% at 0 life. Also added small buffer - full effect when curent HP > 90%.

Made small nerf to Negotiator relic silver sword. Very OP in my opinion, so I reduced vigor regen bonus to 5% and shock dmg to 60.


Version 10

Balanced and reworked several decoctions:

- Fiend decoction. Old effect stays the same (very crappy, just encumbrance bonus). Added new effect - every
melee attack has 30% to apply random buff (burning, blindness, frost slowdown, bleed, poison, long stagger,
knockdown). This is independent from all other buffs.
- Wyvern decoction was boosted. Gives more attack power - 2% per light attack, 3% per heavy, 1% if in whirl.
Also hits will not take away all bonus, but 25% of current bonus + 1%. If attack is partially dodged
that will be reduced by 2 even.
- Arachas (crab spider) decoction effect changed - now simply gives flat 25% damage reduction, not applied to quen only.
- Forktail decoction logic reworked. It now works this way. We have 5 distinct actions: light attack, heavy attack,
counter attack, sign cast, crossbow shot. After certain amount of actions, a boost for other action(s) may be
enabled. When a boosted action is performed, the effect is reset plus one action that was just taken is recorded.
The buffs strength differ between action type and sign type - the tooltip description is just average. Action of
one type will not count towards activation of boost for that type. Using more variety of actions will activate
a boost faster. Examples:
a) Doing 6 times heavy attack will activate boost for every other action (same with other actions, only light
attack counts as 1/2, so 12 needed)
b) Doing 2 times heavy attack and 2 times sign cast, will activate boost for every remaining 3 actions
c) Doing 1 time sign cast, counter and crossbow hit will activate boost for 2 remaining actions
So more variety means you will trigger the boost more often. This is perfect decoction for universal play style.

If you want to test decoctions here is console command for them: additem('Mutagen X'). 17 for forktail,
16 for Fiend, 10 for Wyvern, 2 for Arachas.


Slightly lowered rend armor piercing bonus per skill level (no skill rend still has the same bonus)

Partially dodged attack (so the one that causes graze damage) will now take away 1/3 of current adrenaline
instead of making it zero.



Version 9

Made dodging less pain in the ass against huge, monsters - graze damage has now a cap, that is 600 divided
by player health setting. This is before reduction by skill and armor. Also buffs applied for attacks dodged
by player (but attacks that do hit), will have / 3 general power.


Small evasive action balancing - Cat armor and fleet footed skill graze damage reduction a bit raised.


Version 8

Rebalanced evasice bonuses between fleet footed skill and armor. Fleet footed now gives +5 safe angle per level, but graze dmg reduction is lowered to 5% per level.
Cat (lynx) armor now whole set at lvl 5 gives +16 dodge angle and +12% graze dmg reduction. +9 angle from full light armor.

Added new weapon roll set: 'Magical_Brute' (+crit dmg, - crit chance, -atk speed, + poise dmg, + dmg through blocks)

Injury resist armor attribute now also lowers poise reduction due to low hp (in addition to Heightened Senses skill)


Version 7

- Greatly increased chances of special mutagens drop. To counter that reduced experience gained from decoctions brewing. Still can be adjusted in skill exp mult settings obviously.
- Fixed a bug of attack stamina cost bonus and parry stamina cost bonus on weapons not working at all. Now note that positive value of that param reduced stamina cost, while negative increases. Parry stamina cost
also counts for counter-attacks.
- Damage through blocks weapon attribute now also increases damage taken by enemy, who dodged

Introduced new witcher's weapons roll sets and small balances of few existing:
- ultra light
- light (made a bit less significant, because of introduced ultra light)
- heavy, ultra heavy
- 'overwhelm' (shield break, damage through blocks at the great cost of defense)


Version 6

Continuation of crossbow overhaul:
- Manually aimed shots now have +15% dmg bonus, but not split bolts nor explosives.
- Aimed shots bonus can be further raised with Lightning Reflexes skill: +3.33% per level.
- Auto shots will now have / 1.5 crit chance penalty
- Explosive bolts can deal self damage (it was vanilla bug that they didn't), however reduced self burning
damage greatly
- Adjusted crossbow experience awarding: manually aimed shots will give more exp than auto ones. Due to nature of 
explosive bolts, per target hit exp is much lower.
- mechanics improvement - if Geralt has to reload there are enemies very close, crossbow will force holster instead
This way you can avoid getting stuck for too long with reload and can defend or combo with sword right after shot.
- small input fix - if you cancel aiming by pressing e.g. space then release crossbow button, Geralt will not draw
and shot. That fix doesn't work on horse yet.

Small aard knockdown applicator adjustments.

Version 5

Bolts and crossbow balance and small overhaul. Bolts now differ better between each other and tried to made
other bolt types then explosive more useful. Armor piercing of target point bolts is more siginificant and
at same time precision skill gives less bolt armor piercing bonus. Made crossbow crit damage more significant.
Reduced overpowered burning effect of explosive bolts (duration was too long due to some weird logic). Bolt
prices adjusted. Split bolts deal much more damage (same as bodkin bolt, but have 2, or 3 projectiles), but have
no armor piercing. They are now also great for dealing point blank damage (but not that great on armored).


- red mutagens balance shift - reduced poise they give, increased HP
- green mutagens toxicity bonus boosted a bit


Version 4

- reduced ridiculously hight repair prices of high class equipment. The repair price function is not linear,
but regressive root function. So cheap equipment will still have similar repair prices.
- heightened senses skill small change. instead of percentage poise increase, the skill now gives base poise
of +2, +4, +5 depending on level. The effect of reducing poise reduction due to low hp stays the same.
- updated some ui descriptions

- counter attack skill lvl3 crit chance bonus lowered to +15%
- deadly precision now gives +7% crit chance on counter attack per level instead of 25% on level 3.
Those two defensive skills crit chance was OP concerning other changes in this mod

- steady shot skill damage bonus is now applied multiplicatively to base dmg, not attack power which made that
perk crap. Now it is better in comparison to e.g. Trick Shot


Version 3

- improved aard logic concerning knockdown applicator and force damage calculation - all skills better cowork with each other. scaling is more smooth
  aard is a bit stronger at base, force effects get weaker with lower sign power and increasing sign power does not boost aard that much.
- igni has higher base burn chance, but progresses slower with the 4th skill (skills shouldn be that strong)
- slightly boosted axii base success chance


Version 2

Lowered toxicity of every level white raffard by 5

Introduced new master and magical crafted sword roll sets:
- related with critical hit chance and damage
- new magical one 'StrongOrFast' - gives + str attack power, - str attack speed, - fast attack power, + fast attack speed

Str Training skill heavy attack speed bonus per level slightly lowered to 4.5%


Version 1

- bug fixes - 

poisoned blades skill not working

fixed ridiculous basic quen power

aard sweep fixed and rebalanced starts with -20% power for knockdown applicator, then -10%, 0% on higher levels.
higher levels also increase the values of all types of damages done by aard. /6, /4, /3.


- important mechanics -

Rend is now more armor-piercy, less max damage. Rend with no talent has +15% armor pierce on full load, +5% per skill level.
Also rend now gains base damage faster (fast rends start from great penalty). Boosted crit chance bonus to 7%
per skill level on full load. Rend skill now also raises a bit stamina dmg bonus per level.

Strong attacks have now base dmg multiplier of 1.25, removed attack power bonus of 20%.

eating food will now also give instant heal of small amount, based on food level: 100, 200, 400 accordingly.

Changed the logic of toxicity damage threshold, now it is not constant 50, but following:

  Min ( Max(25 + maxTox / 4.0f, decoction_offset), halfTox)
  
where
  maxTox - maximum toxicity, halfTox - half of toxicity
  decoction_offset - total toxicity of active decoctions
  
Explanation - toxicity damage threshold is increased at 50% rate with higher max tox. But if only decoctions intoxication
is present, the damage is not taken by Geralt. However if decoctions alone use more than 50% of maximum toxicity, that
triggers the damage also. Both 2 toxicity positive bonuses skills are changed so that they are active only if the toxicity
is above the new current threshold. Means that e.g. having just 1 decoction that is not 50% toxicity will not activate
those skills.


- skill balances -

Battle Trance perk now does not cancel basic BT effect which is +10% attack power per vigor point, but just adds its
effect of crit chance per vigor. Lowered that from 8% to 5%.

Hunter Instinct skill boosted to +5% crit damage per level on max vigor. Also the effect is now proportional to the
vigor percentage.

Metabolism perk raised to +25 toxicity (from 15)

Poisoned Blades rebalanced, so that skill level matters more and oil level less. lvl 3 oil and lvl5 skill will give 40%
chance of poisonin. 4% per level, x1,x1.5,x2 for oil levels accordingly.

Fast attacks second skill armor piercing boosted to +3% per skill level. Light attack has no armor piercing initially,
this value should be more significant.

Strong attack second skill small balance shift - armor piercing lowered to +2.5% per level
Crit damage raised to +5%.

Heightened Senses skill now has two new effects:
- increases poise by 5% per level, but not on lvl 3, so 10% max increase
- reduces the amount of poise lowered due to low HP. by 10% per skill level


- alchemy items -

thunderbolt boosted to +10%, 15%, 15% crit chance
cat lvl 1 a bit stronger, lvl2 a bit weaker
boosted a bit lvl2, lvl3 swallow

oils rebalanced to:
lvl1: +10% crit chance, +15% crit dmg
lvl2: +15%, +25%
lvl3: +15%, +30%, +10% reses reduction (exception hangman venom: +15%, +35%, + 5%)

blizzard slow motion duration increased and lvl3 now gives 1s longer duration and again 1s longer if vigor is max


- base attributes -

Geralt's base critical hit damage raised from +25% to +35%

  
- misc -

Samum crit chance bonus (for blinded enemies) changed so that all levels now give some bonus
+15%, +30%, +50%, so lvl is lowered from 100%.

Whirl crit chance is now not 0, but / 2 penalty instead.

Crossbow crit damage 

lowered a bit resist unblockable attacks poise threshold to 100%.


This mod is a publication of my own taste Witcher 3 Enhanced Edition. So obviously credit goes to the god of modding, mighty Reaperzz and all the authors of the mods that he used. The goal is to make W3EE less hardcore and more pleasant to play for not ultra hardcore players. Contains also bugfixes.

Typically most balance changed will be done evening up. So e.g. if I see that skill X is more powerful than Y in my opinion, I will make Y as strong as X. If I see a potion of same tier less powerful/useful than some other I will boost it.
