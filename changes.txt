Version 22

Major Axii logic overhaul.
1) Fixed some bugs related with duration and chance calculation.
2) Normalized durations, small balancing in enemies will resistances.

3) Introduced new concept: 'Axii casting level'. Influences many factors, such as: slowdown when casting strength,
maximum number of enemies that can have axii slowdown effect when casting, range and cone angle for target selection.
Axii casting level can be 0-8. 3 levels per each Delusion skill level. 1 for 2nd level of puppet. 2 for 2nd,3rd
level of Domination. And 2 extra when having Petri's philter lvl 3 effect.

4) Axii puppet skill attack power bonus a bit nerfed and skill has now better scaling of chance to break spell when Geralt
hits enemies - you still can use puppet to get easy hits.

5) Changed Axii Link skill to Deep Confusion skill. I don't like how Axii Link effect was made so I disabled it
totally. For example - when you have domination and many puppets/confused, hitting one can result in unnecesary
spell break on others. So now Deep Confusion skill has three effects:
- axii spell power (as vanilla)
- gives a chance to drain full stamina when spell ends (modified from W3EE when it happened always, now 10% chance
per skill level, also glyphword 13 increases that chance by 30%).
- increaeses crit chance and dmg against axied enemies by 3% per skill level and scales a bit with spellpower

6) Domination skill reworked. Now first target faces Axii cast with full power. Each subsequent enemy gets the
power reduced.

7) Axii related glyphwords have now better scaled durations extensions based on axii spellpower value on given
target's effect and confusion resistances. Strongest glyphword has now 30% drain stamina chance
- cumulates with Deep Confusion skill.

Axii spellpower scales 3 things: duration, Deep Confusion skill's crit chance and damage and also
slowdown when casting. Slowdown when casting is not that overwhelming anymore - you need a bit more skill for
successful Axii casts (puppet mostly, because takes long time). However with high Axii casting level it is quite
easy, because the number of slowed down enemies can be very high.

Small adjustment in whirl - the amount of damage reduced when resisting pariable attack depends now on skill level.
Ranges from 25% on level zero to 100% on level 3+.

Adjusted a bit poise toxicity curve (from quadratic to 1.5 exponent), so there will be faster poise gain with
growing toxicity.

Boosted a bit Petri's philtre spell power, +5% all levels.


Version 21

Reworked poise and stagger resist while whirling logic. Gives more smooth scaling over poise value and whirl skill level.
Most important fact is that unblockable attacks threshold was lowered even further to 60 poise, but such attacks also 
require successful poise roll reduced by the threshold value. For example if you stand still and have 80 poise, receive
unblockable hit, you will have 80 - 60 = 20% chance to not stagger. While when it comes to blockable attacks that chance is 80%.
That threshold can be lowered even more by:
1) medium armor perk (but value nerfed to -5 per armor piece.
2) level 5 whirl skill
3) Earth elemental decoction

Reworked alghoul mutagen. Now increases adrenaline gain by 33% and makes your adrenaline increase also your attack power
and poise by values at rate current adrenaline percentage / 4.

Version 20

This is an updates of boosts so greatly in the sense of this mod :).

Changes in adrenaline loosing logic. Now there is some chance to maintain at least some portion of adrenaline. Heavy and medium armor parts increase that chance.
Also dodged attack with graze damage still reduces the lost adrenaline by 3.

Whirl skill level requirement for higher breaking prevention mechanics lowered. Was 3,5, now 2,4. 5th level gives extra stagger resist chance.

Reworked 2 decoctions:
1) Czart decoction - pretty simple - immunity to bleeding, poison and burning plus small extra reses to elemental, blunt and piercing damage.
2) Earth elemental decoction. Inherited the vanilla effect of Czart decoction. However mechanics had to be reworked completelly to fit to the W3EE
poise and stagger logic. Non power gamer just need to know this: greatly increases your overall stagger resistance including breaking from whirl.
Also breaking from whirl will only result in normal stagger instead of long. Reduced knockdown effect to stagger as it was. Poise and whirl skill
level still matters. It will enhance your stagger resistance always and will not be that great if your base stagger resistance factors are low.

When updating from pre 20 version it is recommended not to load a save in which you have active effect of either Czart or Earth Elemental decoction.


Version 19

Tawny Owl nerfed all levels. Noticed that actually this potion was ultra op, completelly removing a need to manage
stamina in most fights. Now is more balanced. Small decrease in toxicity of the potion in return.

Balanced better armor influence on stamina regen - adjusted weights - fixup after armor logic rework in previous
version.

Reworked Attack is the best defense perk to finally work as it should. When low on stamina, gives small stamina
gain when performing offensive sword action (but not Rend), counter or offensive kick. Effect has 9 sec cooldown.
So this perk effect will not be triggered on just passive defense.

Yrden small balance shift - basic slowdown is 20% stronger, but effects of 3rd and 4th skills for basic Yrden
nerfed about the same.

Condotiere relic boosts lowered reses, but added graze dmg reduction and special prop - lower defense stamina cost.

Added crafting recipe for stronger blunt bolts. Should be available where the ordinary one was. In console item
code: 'Blunt Bolt Legendary schematic'.

Bear and Lynx crossbows small adjustments.

Fixed a bug of wrong stamina regen display in character stats.


Version 18

Major improvement in armor logic towards possiblity of mixing armor types. In W3EE armor has many influences
that are not listed in item's tooltips, some listed on stats screen. So they are: action speed influence, poise, stamina cost of actions.
1) Now armor parts are not just counted, but they have weights when it comes to speed influence, poise and stamina costs
so standard average became weighted average. The weights are following:
body: 45%, pants: 25%, gloves and boots: 15%
For example if you have no armor, the attack speed bonus is now + 4.8%. If you put on just heavy body part, it will drop down to ~0.
Similar if you have no chest armor and put on heavy gloves, boots and pants. If you put all heavy, it will be then -4.8%. And the opposite
way - body part will give you the highest poise gain.
2) Now all the armor pieces influence all of: attack speed, evasion speed. Boundaries (so values when all naked or all heavy) were adjusted
a bit. I see no logical reason why pants and boots shouldn't influence attack speed, as obviously whole body is involved in proper attacks of a witcher.
3) Basic light, medium, heavy set bonuses will now also work with 2,3 pieces of the kind. 4 is the full bonus, while 2,3 is 33%, 66% of the bonus.
So e.g. wearing 2 medium armor parts will give you -3.33% stamina action cost, instead of full -10%.

Various armor items balances:
- wolf, bear and manticore sets have now some bleeding resistance
- nerfed a bit wolf and bear adrenaline gain bonus
- wolf pants have now small bludgeoning resistance
- bear chest and pants have monster dmg resistance a bit lowered, but gloves and boots have 1% boosts of reses on average
- assasin's pants (relic) have now extra small elemental resistance
- assasin's boots (relic) have now dodge angle bonus (like cat set, a bit stronger)

Improved Strength training stagger part logic. Now - if there are other sources of stagger buff (like Stribog) rune it is added together
with the Strenght Training amount. This results in a bit higher stagger probability and also counting when parried. Stribog rune lvl1,2 also
boosted a bit.
    
Cat School light armor perk boosted a bit to 6% per piece.

Bear school heavy armor perk boosted with new prop - +2% dmg through blocks and dodges per piece. Bear school witcher knows how to use
heaviness of the armor to enhance his blows.

Adjusted a bit toxicity dmg curve, so that dmg is increased lower with great intoxication with high max toxicity. To counter that also
Heightened tolerance small nerf.

Boosted Synergy for green mutagens adrenaline gain by 50%. So now 1 extra toxicity is 1.5% adrenaline gain bonus instead of previous 1%.

Version 17

Boosted a bit echidna decoction, 20% more healing rate.

Boosted a bit archgriffin decoction - uses a bit less extra stamina - 25%. And the hit enemy extra hp drain is 3% for
25 stamina. Scales lineary.

Boosted a bit lvl3 thunderbolt - has now +18% crit chance, crit frenzy duration raised to 2.5s.

Several skills balancing.
1) Anatomical Knowledge has now max level 4. Same effect per level.
2) Undying max level was lowered to 4 and boosted overall gain per skill level.
3) Heightened Tolerance has now max level 4. Gives 9% toxicity damage reduction per level. And took over the vitality
regen part from Endure Pain skill. Vitality regen reduction on full toxicity is now 50% and reduced by 6% per skill level.
4) Endure Pain skill doesn't concern vitality regen anymore. Chance of loosing adrenaline when toxicity is above safe
threshold is now 70% at base and reduced by 7% per skill level up to 35%. Was 100%->50%.
5) Killing Spree skill has now max level 4 and nerfed to 2.5% extra crit chance per killed enemy per skill level.
6) Lowered adrenaline gain bonus for Acquired Tolerance to 2% per skill level.

Reworked how Trial of Grasses exp is gained. At base it has lower gain rate, but is boosted by both potion toxicity,
decoctions are the stronges and current intoxication. Also fixed here a bug - decoction extra xp didn't work.
Small other exp gain adjustments, battle trance a bit boosted.

Stribog rune boosted to +5% lvl 3. Weles runes adjusted to +2%,+3%,+4% sign power.

Lowered chance of getting fogling, echidna, wraith mutagens - so all those that drop for common monsters.

Version 16

Devil's puffbal small balancing, a bit longer effect duration, shorter cloud duration.

Crippling shot adjustment - 15% immobilize chance on crit per skill level. /2 if non crit, /2 if non manually
aimed shot. Both penalties can stack. Raised to 9% strength of bleeding chance and buff to broadhead bolts.

Counter Attack skill lvl crit chance boost lowered to +5%.

Deadly precision crit chance after counter raised to +8% per level. Lvl1 now also gives 15% huge enemies/staggering
attacks dmg reducion. As this skill has low effect overall, boosting is fine.

Tissue Transmutation skill boosted to 250 HP gain per level.

Werewolf decoction has now additional effect - halves stamina cost of all movement actions: sprint, jumb, doge, roll.

Cockatrice decoction boosted overall (time slowdown and action speed). Timeout raised to 4.5s. However attack power
lowered to small gain 1% per hit. So that it is not redundant with Wyvern decoction. Its main purpose is reflex
boost, which must be high, because the effect is reset when getting just one hit or after timeout.

Succubus decoction boosted a bit to +25% attack power after 125 seconds of combat.

Enhanced armor and weapons (sharpener, armorer bench) effects nerfed to +10%.

Lowered chance of receiving earth elemental mutagen (not considered ultra rare, but rare, which is 50% chance).

Again small nerf to aard Shock Wave base dmg lowered to 220 per skill level.

Experience rates and curves overhaul.
1) Changed the way of lowering exp gain rate. Previously exp for given path was lowered only based on skill points
allocated just that path. Now this penalty is reduced, but intead another multiplicative penalty is added - based
on overall number of skill points. This way it is easier to do more specialized builds - if you skip some skill
columns on purpose, you will gain more exp in others.
2) General skill exp gain was lowered and penalty when having more perks is more harsh. That is mostly because
in this mod, perks are boosted, so one should have less amount of them.
3) Other base exp rates modifications: signs - lowered on average like 20-30%. Crossbow - lowered about 30% and
non aimed shots give much less exp. Defense - lowered about 25%. Oils - raised about 25%, bombs lowered a bit, but
bombs also give exp on hits. mutation - raised like 15%. One decoction brewing has much lower factor, but more
mutagens available.
4) Sword battle trance path way of gaining exp reworked totally. Now it works this way - when in combat, a timer
ticks every short amount of time. In each tick you get an exp amount that is proportional to the current vigor.
Also being active in combat, hitting enemies increase the gain. So having more vigor and being active makes the
progress faster. Also there is big one time exp award for each Flood of Anger usage - because it is an active
skill that drains most vigor, so that needs to be compensated.

Version 15

Fixed and updated UI descriptions for previous changes - green mutagen value in character menu and wraith decoction.

Small nerf to aard Shock Wave base dmg: 290 to 250 per skill level.

Bombs small general overhaul.
- Steady Aim skill now also increases explosion radius by 5% per skill level
- Pyrotechnics skill is boosted to 150 extra dmg per skill level
- Overall petard impact/explosion damage is nerfed to 85% of original value
- Reworked cluster Bombs skill. It is now meant to be more pro/con skill. Cluster petards are less reliable, deal
much less damage per cluster, but cover larger area and on average deal more total damage. So main bomb explosion
only releases clusters (as vanilla), damage reduction is 50%, with more cluster even a bit more up to 60% at skill
level 5. Number of clusters is 3 on lvl 1, then +0.5 per level up to 5 on lvl 5. Advanced pyrotechnics perk still
gives always +1 cluster. E.g. 3.5 clusters means 50% chance for 4 clusters, 3 otherwise. Fixed also a bug - Dragon's
Dream is affected by cluster dmg reduction now.

Balancing over most bombs:
- Northern Wind nerfed - it was ultra OP, now has lower loop duration (lvl1,2), and frost damage minimized to very
small values.
- Samum has longer effect duration
- Devil's Puffbal poison damage boosted.
- small nerf to Dancing Star burning damage
- Grapeshot lvl3 a bit boosted and causes long stagger effect
- Dragon's Dream explosion damage boosted - this was too weak, because burning effect from that petard is weaker
than Dancing Star


Version 14

Fixed a bug of overpowered Temerian, Nilfgard and Skellige armor available to buy. They were actually NG+ version
but it is irrelevant with W3EE, so always the merchants should have base versions.

Boosted Skellige heavy armor rending resistance.

Synergy for green mutagen now gives adrenaline gain bonus instead of toxicity. Conversion is 1 tox to 1% adrenaline
gain. That is because toxicity should be limited and there are other skills to increase it already. Adrenaline gain
bonus fits great for high tox builds, because it works together great with the trial of grasses skill that reduces
your chance of loosing adrenaline when hit. So for example with one greater green mutagen and synergy level 5
you will get 0.25 * 24 = 6 -> 6% adrenaline gain bonus.

Acquired tolerance skill now also gives small adrenaline gain - 3% per skill level.


Added new magical sword roll set - diligent: +crit chance, + attack stamina cost bonus, + adrenaline gain, - attack power, - crit damage


Version 13

Food regen now also has effect in combat (surprised it didn't as it is such low value).

Made gourmet perk reasonable: +25% instant heal, +35% food regen value, +25% duration.

Troll decoction in combat regen boosted, so it is stronger than lvl3 swallow. Out of combat regen reduced, but still
stronger than combat one.

Grave Hag mutagen boosted - gives better regen gain per kill, but max stack is 7.

Wraith decoction reworked, so it is usable - any hit can trigger quen, but the chance gets higher with stronger hits
and more overall damage taken. Received damage increases gradually chance and is not reset between combats, so having
bad luck long time raises chance of triggering quen greatly.

Lowered a bit ranged combat experience gain rates.


Version 12

Geralt's base HP raised to 6300, but well rested effects now grants just 500 health.

Further toxicity balancing:
- Acquired tolerance skill toxicity increase changed - instreado of 10% per level, now grants flat 12 toxicity per level
- Adaptation skill changes reverted

Attack is the Best Defense perk boosted - reactivation after 8sec. Also this perk now does not affect parry, as it is cheapest action.

Battle Trance perk nerfed to 4% crit chance per vigor point.

In Combat's Fires perk effect reverted back to vanilla - Geralt ignores own bombs and bolts damage and effects.

Advanced pyrotechnics perk now additionally has an effect of W3EE "In Combat's Fires" in addition to extra cluster.

Changed how Preparation -> Yield setting works. Now it sets the amount of prepared oil or potion to: yield value / 2.
Allowing half quantity value. So e.g. if yield is set to 3, then there is 50% chance of preparing 2 items, otherwise 1.
Similar rule as with bombs optimization skill. Yield setting value 2 or less simply means 1.


Version 11

Crossbow and bolts:
- increased armor piercing values of target point bolts a bit
- Cold Blooded skill boosted - bonus per hit. Max boost remains the same. Also raised to 7s effect reset time.
- Crippling shots skill improved for broadhead bolts. Since bleeding is not stacking, instead for that type of
bolts bleeding effect is simply boosted - by about 8% per skill level.

Cooking:
- Small adjustments in food, so that recipes are more logical and balanced in two ways: multiplying food, 
upgrading food to better quality.

Big toxicity rework. First of all removed strange rule of greatly increasing potions toxicity when decoctions
active. I find it nonsense, because there is no point in investing in toxicity (green mutagens, perk, also
red wolf armor), if you cannot use normal potions with reasonable efficiency in addition to decoctions. So that
needed some balancing and nerfing some toxicity capabilities.
- Mutant skill decoctions toxicity per level reduced to 2, but duration is increased to 15% per skill level.
- Red wolf armor set toxicity gain overall reduced from 30 to 21.
- Metabolism perk toxicity gain reduced from 25 to 20
- Reduced the rate at which toxicity safe threshold is increased. Now it is increased by value of 1/6 of max tox
above 100 (was 1/4), so if you have 200 max tox. Threshold will be 66.667 (with exception of decoctions rule).
- food instant heal amount is reduced when intoxicated - progressive almost quadratic function, so will be small when
low tox, up to zero on 100% tox.

Potions adjustments. Two goals - increase toxicity where the gain from higher lvl potion is great and increase
the differences between potion tiers, where they were insignificant.
- Maribor forest. Lvl1 duration reduced, Lvl2 duration increased as it is the only gain. Lvl3 even more duration
and restores 2 vigor points instantly. Toxicity of lvl2, lvl3 raised.
- Golden oriole lvl1 doesn't give full poison res anymore, but 75% combined with Geralt base res, but toxicity reduced.
Lvl3 toxicity raised as its effect is very strong - healing with poison.
- Thunderbolt lvl3 has higher tox, but also longer duration and increased a bit crit frenzy activation chance.
- Cat was really overpowered in general, so lvl2,3 toxicities raised. all levels have lower duration, but still
quite high compared to other potions on average.


Water Hag decoction bug fix, so now it really works according to descriptions. Gives +20% attack power on full life,
then reducing proportionaly to 0% at 0 life. Also added small buffer - full effect when curent HP > 90%.

Made small nerf to Negotiator relic silver sword. Very OP in my opinion, so I reduced vigor regen bonus to 5% and shock dmg to 60.


Version 10

Balanced and reworked several decoctions:

- Fiend decoction. Old effect stays the same (very crappy, just encumbrance bonus). Added new effect - every
melee attack has 30% to apply random buff (burning, blindness, frost slowdown, bleed, poison, long stagger,
knockdown). This is independent from all other buffs.
- Wyvern decoction was boosted. Gives more attack power - 2% per light attack, 3% per heavy, 1% if in whirl.
Also hits will not take away all bonus, but 25% of current bonus + 1%. If attack is partially dodged
that will be reduced by 2 even.
- Arachas (crab spider) decoction effect changed - now simply gives flat 25% damage reduction, not applied to quen only.
- Forktail decoction logic reworked. It now works this way. We have 5 distinct actions: light attack, heavy attack,
counter attack, sign cast, crossbow shot. After certain amount of actions, a boost for other action(s) may be
enabled. When a boosted action is performed, the effect is reset plus one action that was just taken is recorded.
The buffs strength differ between action type and sign type - the tooltip description is just average. Action of
one type will not count towards activation of boost for that type. Using more variety of actions will activate
a boost faster. Examples:
a) Doing 6 times heavy attack will activate boost for every other action (same with other actions, only light
attack counts as 1/2, so 12 needed)
b) Doing 2 times heavy attack and 2 times sign cast, will activate boost for every remaining 3 actions
c) Doing 1 time sign cast, counter and crossbow hit will activate boost for 2 remaining actions
So more variety means you will trigger the boost more often. This is perfect decoction for universal play style.

If you want to test decoctions here is console command for them: additem('Mutagen X'). 17 for forktail,
16 for Fiend, 10 for Wyvern, 2 for Arachas.


Slightly lowered rend armor piercing bonus per skill level (no skill rend still has the same bonus)

Partially dodged attack (so the one that causes graze damage) will now take away 1/3 of current adrenaline
instead of making it zero.



Version 9

Made dodging less pain in the ass against huge, monsters - graze damage has now a cap, that is 600 divided
by player health setting. This is before reduction by skill and armor. Also buffs applied for attacks dodged
by player (but attacks that do hit), will have / 3 general power.


Small evasive action balancing - Cat armor and fleet footed skill graze damage reduction a bit raised.


Version 8

Rebalanced evasice bonuses between fleet footed skill and armor. Fleet footed now gives +5 safe angle per level, but graze dmg reduction is lowered to 5% per level.
Cat (lynx) armor now whole set at lvl 5 gives +16 dodge angle and +12% graze dmg reduction. +9 angle from full light armor.

Added new weapon roll set: 'Magical_Brute' (+crit dmg, - crit chance, -atk speed, + poise dmg, + dmg through blocks)

Injury resist armor attribute now also lowers poise reduction due to low hp (in addition to Heightened Senses skill)


Version 7

- Greatly increased chances of special mutagens drop. To counter that reduced experience gained from decoctions brewing. Still can be adjusted in skill exp mult settings obviously.
- Fixed a bug of attack stamina cost bonus and parry stamina cost bonus on weapons not working at all. Now note that positive value of that param reduced stamina cost, while negative increases. Parry stamina cost
also counts for counter-attacks.
- Damage through blocks weapon attribute now also increases damage taken by enemy, who dodged

Introduced new witcher's weapons roll sets and small balances of few existing:
- ultra light
- light (made a bit less significant, because of introduced ultra light)
- heavy, ultra heavy
- 'overwhelm' (shield break, damage through blocks at the great cost of defense)


Version 6

Continuation of crossbow overhaul:
- Manually aimed shots now have +15% dmg bonus, but not split bolts nor explosives.
- Aimed shots bonus can be further raised with Lightning Reflexes skill: +3.33% per level.
- Auto shots will now have / 1.5 crit chance penalty
- Explosive bolts can deal self damage (it was vanilla bug that they didn't), however reduced self burning
damage greatly
- Adjusted crossbow experience awarding: manually aimed shots will give more exp than auto ones. Due to nature of 
explosive bolts, per target hit exp is much lower.
- mechanics improvement - if Geralt has to reload there are enemies very close, crossbow will force holster instead
This way you can avoid getting stuck for too long with reload and can defend or combo with sword right after shot.
- small input fix - if you cancel aiming by pressing e.g. space then release crossbow button, Geralt will not draw
and shot. That fix doesn't work on horse yet.

Small aard knockdown applicator adjustments.

Version 5

Bolts and crossbow balance and small overhaul. Bolts now differ better between each other and tried to made
other bolt types then explosive more useful. Armor piercing of target point bolts is more siginificant and
at same time precision skill gives less bolt armor piercing bonus. Made crossbow crit damage more significant.
Reduced overpowered burning effect of explosive bolts (duration was too long due to some weird logic). Bolt
prices adjusted. Split bolts deal much more damage (same as bodkin bolt, but have 2, or 3 projectiles), but have
no armor piercing. They are now also great for dealing point blank damage (but not that great on armored).


- red mutagens balance shift - reduced poise they give, increased HP
- green mutagens toxicity bonus boosted a bit


Version 4

- reduced ridiculously hight repair prices of high class equipment. The repair price function is not linear,
but regressive root function. So cheap equipment will still have similar repair prices.
- heightened senses skill small change. instead of percentage poise increase, the skill now gives base poise
of +2, +4, +5 depending on level. The effect of reducing poise reduction due to low hp stays the same.
- updated some ui descriptions

- counter attack skill lvl3 crit chance bonus lowered to +15%
- deadly precision now gives +7% crit chance on counter attack per level instead of 25% on level 3.
Those two defensive skills crit chance was OP concerning other changes in this mod

- steady shot skill damage bonus is now applied multiplicatively to base dmg, not attack power which made that
perk crap. Now it is better in comparison to e.g. Trick Shot


Version 3

- improved aard logic concerning knockdown applicator and force damage calculation - all skills better cowork with each other. scaling is more smooth
  aard is a bit stronger at base, force effects get weaker with lower sign power and increasing sign power does not boost aard that much.
- igni has higher base burn chance, but progresses slower with the 4th skill (skills shouldn be that strong)
- slightly boosted axii base success chance


Version 2

Lowered toxicity of every level white raffard by 5

Introduced new master and magical crafted sword roll sets:
- related with critical hit chance and damage
- new magical one 'StrongOrFast' - gives + str attack power, - str attack speed, - fast attack power, + fast attack speed

Str Training skill heavy attack speed bonus per level slightly lowered to 4.5%


Version 1

- bug fixes - 

poisoned blades skill not working

fixed ridiculous basic quen power

aard sweep fixed and rebalanced starts with -20% power for knockdown applicator, then -10%, 0% on higher levels.
higher levels also increase the values of all types of damages done by aard. /6, /4, /3.


- important mechanics -

Rend is now more armor-piercy, less max damage. Rend with no talent has +15% armor pierce on full load, +5% per skill level.
Also rend now gains base damage faster (fast rends start from great penalty). Boosted crit chance bonus to 7%
per skill level on full load. Rend skill now also raises a bit stamina dmg bonus per level.

Strong attacks have now base dmg multiplier of 1.25, removed attack power bonus of 20%.

eating food will now also give instant heal of small amount, based on food level: 100, 200, 400 accordingly.

Changed the logic of toxicity damage threshold, now it is not constant 50, but following:

  Min ( Max(25 + maxTox / 4.0f, decoction_offset), halfTox)
  
where
  maxTox - maximum toxicity, halfTox - half of toxicity
  decoction_offset - total toxicity of active decoctions
  
Explanation - toxicity damage threshold is increased at 50% rate with higher max tox. But if only decoctions intoxication
is present, the damage is not taken by Geralt. However if decoctions alone use more than 50% of maximum toxicity, that
triggers the damage also. Both 2 toxicity positive bonuses skills are changed so that they are active only if the toxicity
is above the new current threshold. Means that e.g. having just 1 decoction that is not 50% toxicity will not activate
those skills.


- skill balances -

Battle Trance perk now does not cancel basic BT effect which is +10% attack power per vigor point, but just adds its
effect of crit chance per vigor. Lowered that from 8% to 5%.

Hunter Instinct skill boosted to +5% crit damage per level on max vigor. Also the effect is now proportional to the
vigor percentage.

Metabolism perk raised to +25 toxicity (from 15)

Poisoned Blades rebalanced, so that skill level matters more and oil level less. lvl 3 oil and lvl5 skill will give 40%
chance of poisonin. 4% per level, x1,x1.5,x2 for oil levels accordingly.

Fast attacks second skill armor piercing boosted to +3% per skill level. Light attack has no armor piercing initially,
this value should be more significant.

Strong attack second skill small balance shift - armor piercing lowered to +2.5% per level
Crit damage raised to +5%.

Heightened Senses skill now has two new effects:
- increases poise by 5% per level, but not on lvl 3, so 10% max increase
- reduces the amount of poise lowered due to low HP. by 10% per skill level


- alchemy items -

thunderbolt boosted to +10%, 15%, 15% crit chance
cat lvl 1 a bit stronger, lvl2 a bit weaker
boosted a bit lvl2, lvl3 swallow

oils rebalanced to:
lvl1: +10% crit chance, +15% crit dmg
lvl2: +15%, +25%
lvl3: +15%, +30%, +10% reses reduction (exception hangman venom: +15%, +35%, + 5%)

blizzard slow motion duration increased and lvl3 now gives 1s longer duration and again 1s longer if vigor is max


- base attributes -

Geralt's base critical hit damage raised from +25% to +35%

  
- misc -

Samum crit chance bonus (for blinded enemies) changed so that all levels now give some bonus
+15%, +30%, +50%, so lvl is lowered from 100%.

Whirl crit chance is now not 0, but / 2 penalty instead.

Crossbow crit damage 

lowered a bit resist unblockable attacks poise threshold to 100%.


This mod is a publication of my own taste Witcher 3 Enhanced Edition. So obviously credit goes to the god of modding, mighty Reaperzz and all the authors of the mods that he used. The goal is to make W3EE less hardcore and more pleasant to play for not ultra hardcore players. Contains also bugfixes.

Typically most balance changed will be done evening up. So e.g. if I see that skill X is more powerful than Y in my opinion, I will make Y as strong as X. If I see a potion of same tier less powerful/useful than some other I will boost it.

Brief changes list:
- bug fixes - 
poisoned blades skill not working
fixed ridiculous basic quen power
aard sweep fixed and rebalanced starts with -20% power for knockdown applicator, then -10%, 0% on higher levels.
higher levels also increase the values of all types of damages done by aard. /6, /4, /3.

- important mechanics -
Rend is now more armor-piercy, less max damage. Rend with no talent has +15% armor pierce on full load, +5% per skill level.
Also rend now gains base damage faster (fast rends start from great penalty). Boosted crit chance bonus to 7%
per skill level on full load. Rend skill now also raises a bit stamina dmg bonus per level.
Strong attacks have now base dmg multiplier of 1.25, removed attack power bonus of 20%.
eating food will now also give instant heal of small amount, based on food level: 100, 200, 400 accordingly.
Changed the logic of toxicity damage threshold, now it is not constant 50, but following:
  Min ( Max(25 + maxTox / 4.0f, decoction_offset), halfTox)
  
where
  maxTox - maximum toxicity, halfTox - half of toxicity
  decoction_offset - total toxicity of active decoctions
  
Explanation - toxicity damage threshold is increased at 50% rate with higher max tox. But if only decoctions intoxication
is present, the damage is not taken by Geralt. However if decoctions alone use more than 50% of maximum toxicity, that
triggers the damage also. Both 2 toxicity positive bonuses skills are changed so that they are active only if the toxicity
is above the new current threshold. Means that e.g. having just 1 decoction that is not 50% toxicity will not activate
those skills.

- skill balances -
Battle Trance perk now does not cancel basic BT effect which is +10% attack power per vigor point, but just adds its
effect of crit chance per vigor. Lowered that from 8% to 5%.
Hunter Instinct skill boosted to +5% crit damage per level on max vigor. Also the effect is now proportional to the
vigor percentage.
Metabolism perk raised to +25 toxicity (from 15)
Poisoned Blades rebalanced, so that skill level matters more and oil level less. lvl 3 oil and lvl5 skill will give 40%
chance of poisonin. 4% per level, x1,x1.5,x2 for oil levels accordingly.
Fast attacks second skill armor piercing boosted to +3% per skill level. Light attack has no armor piercing initially,
this value should be more significant.
Strong attack second skill small balance shift - armor piercing lowered to +2.5% per level
Crit damage raised to +5%.
Heightened Senses skill now has two new effects:
- increases poise by 5% per level, but not on lvl 3, so 10% max increase
- reduces the amount of poise lowered due to low HP. by 10% per skill level

- alchemy items -
thunderbolt boosted to +10%, 15%, 15% crit chance
cat lvl 1 a bit stronger, lvl2 a bit weaker
boosted a bit lvl2, lvl3 swallow
oils rebalanced to:
lvl1: +10% crit chance, +15% crit dmg
lvl2: +15%, +25%
lvl3: +15%, +30%, +10% reses reduction (exception hangman venom: +15%, +35%, + 5%)
blizzard slow motion duration increased and lvl3 now gives 1s longer duration and again 1s longer if vigor is max

- base attributes -
Geralt's base critical hit damage raised from +25% to +35%
  
- misc -
Samum crit chance bonus (for blinded enemies) changed so that all levels now give some bonus
+15%, +30%, +50%, so lvl is lowered from 100%.
Whirl crit chance is now not 0, but / 2 penalty instead.
Crossbow crit damage 
lowered a bit resist unblockable attacks poise threshold to 100%.
