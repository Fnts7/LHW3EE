Geralt's base critical hit damage raised from +25% to +35%


- skill balances -

Battle Trance perk now does not cancel basic BT effect which is +10% attack power per vigor point, but just adds its
effect of crit chance per vigor. Lowered that from 8% to 5%.

Hunter Instinct skill boosted to +10% crit damage per level on max vigor. Also the effect is now proportional to the
vigor percentage.

Metabolism perk raised to +25 toxicity (from 15)

Poisoned Blades rebalanced, so that skill level matters more and oil level less. lvl 3 oil and lvl5 skill will give 40%
chance of poisonin. 4% per level, x1,x1.5,x2 for oil levels accordingly.

Fast attacks second skill armor piercing boosted to +4% per skill level. Light attack has no armor piercing initially,
this value should be more significant.

first defensive skill now also reduces the amount of poise lowered due to low HP. by 15% per skill level


- alchemy items -

thunderbolt boosted to +10%, 15%, 15% crit chance
cat lvl 1 a bit stronger, lvl2 a bit weaker
boosted a bit lvl2, lvl3 swallow

oils rebalanced to:
lvl1: +10% crit chance, +20% crit dmg
lvl2: +15%, +30%
lvl3: +15%, +35%, +10% reses reduction


- bug fixes - 

poisoned blades skill not working

fixed ridiculous basic quen power

aard sweep fixed and rebalanced starts with -20% power for knockdown applicator, then -10%, 0% on higher levels.
higher levels also increase the values of all types of damages done by aard. /6, /4, /3.


- mechanics -

Rend is now more armor-piercy, less max damage. Rend with no talent has +15% armor pierce on full load, +7% per skill level.
Also rend now gains base damage faster (fast rends start from great penalty).

Strong attacks have now base dmg multiplier of 1.25, removed attack power bonus of 20%.

eating food will now also give instant heal of small amount, based on food level: 100, 200, 400 accordingly.

Changed the logic of toxicity damage threshold, now it is not constant 50, but following:

  Min ( Max(25 + maxTox / 4.0f, decoction_offset), halfTox)
  
where
  maxTox - maximum toxicity, halfTox - half of toxicity
  decoction_offset - total toxicity of active decoctions
  
Explanation - toxicity damage threshold is increased at 50% rate with higher max tox. But if only decoctions intoxication
is present, the damage is not taken by Geralt. However if decoctions alone use more than 50% of maximum toxicity, that
triggers the damage also. Both 2 toxicity positive bonuses skills are changed so that they are active only if the toxicity
is above the new current threshold. Means that e.g. having just 1 decoction that is not 50% toxicity will not activate
those skills.
  
- misc -

Samum crit chance bonus (for blinded enemies) changed so that all levels now give some bonus
+15%, +30%, +50%, so lvl is lowered from 100%.

Whirl crit chance is now not 0, but / 2 penalty instead.

Crossbow crit damage 

lowered a bit resist unblockable attacks poise threshold to 100%.
